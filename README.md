# Search-Phones-on-Amazon-Power-BI
Analyzing the performance of the most popular and highly rated phones on Amazon to identify opportunities to improve sales and marketing visibility.
# ðŸ“Œ Overview
- Amazon's mobile phone market presents an analytical challenge due to the vast amount of unstructured data and the need for analysts to have standardized key performance metrics (KPIs) to compare products fairly.
- This project provided a comprehensive analytical workflow, spanning from data acquisition to interactive dashboard creation, with a focus on extracting insights that support informed purchasing and marketing decisions.
# âš™ Data Preparation (Data Cleaning)
- Duplicate rows were removed.
- Columns with missing values greater than 90% were removed.
- Texts in the Sales Volume column were removed and filled with the median.
- Thus, each column was processed appropriately.
